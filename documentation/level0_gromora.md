# GROMORA level 0

## Summary
This file describes the raw file (level 0) from GROMOS and SOMORA. It is potentially applicable to other MW radiometers designed at the IAP as the fields entries are often quite similar.

The raw MW data actually contain two files:
* a binary file with the raw spectral spectrometers voltages or counts
* a text file (the so-called log file) which contains all additional meta data. Each line of this text file correspond to a single spectrum in the binary file.

Note that many parameters (especially the older analog sensors) were simply not used and some of them were measuring unknown quantities which are therefore not used in the calibration routine.

## Standard parameters

In order for the calibration routine to be as generic as possible, there are a set of standard log parameters in the log file. Most of them are present in the original log file from the instruments but most often with different naming conventions. Therefore, it was decided to harmonize the naming of the log variables so that it can be used later on in the routine in a generic way. In this section, we enumerate the different log variables needed to run the calibration and list the corresponding original (OG) variables names in GROMOS and SOMORA log files.

## Instrument specific parameters

### GROMOS

For GROMOS, there are a few key changes made to the log file during the decade 2010-2020:
1. 10.03.2010: before this date, the positions of the mirror were coded as strings (e.g. "COLD")
2. 06.05.2010: the binary filename extension chaned from ***.dat*** to ***.bin***.
3. 13.05.2010: start of T_room measurement
4. 13.09.2011: introduction of new temperature sensors with much more measurements after this time (see below). 

For more information on the temporal changes of the log file, see the [harmonize_log_gromos](../scripts/calibration/harmonize_log_gromos.m) function in the calibration folder.

### SOMORA

SOMORA raw files are slightly more "stable" than the GROMOS ones with time.

For more information on the temporal changes of the log file, see the [harmonize_log_somora](../scripts/calibration/harmonize_log_somora.m) function in the calibration folder.
