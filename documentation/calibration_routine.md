# Calibration routine

## Objective and role of this function
Calibrate the observations from the instruments against the hot and cold load on a given "calibration time".


### Calls from
Main routine

### Calling
None

### Previously
Quality control of the raw data

### Next
Quality control for the calibrated spectra ? 

## Inputs
* Raw data
* Calibration time
* Instruments name ?

## Outputs
* Calibrated spectra
* Error code for the calibration

## Structure
We should include the possibility to use the tipping curve calibrations done by the instruments approx. every 30 min. 


## How it was done in the past
### GROMOS


### SOMORA


## Questions remaining
