# Inputs

This documents lists all required inputs needed to perform calibration and retrievals of GROSOM data. It is divided first between calibration and retrieval part and by instruments.

## Calibration

### Raw data
For each instrument, a .bin and a .txt log file per day have to be accessed to make the calibration. 

For GROMOS, it is not located on the datalake and can be mounted as describred on the IAP Wiki.

For SOMORA: currently on a hard disk at IAP.

### Meteo data
Some meteo data are also required for the calibration process, especially for the integration of the spectra to decide which to keep or not. 

For GROMOS: Data from the IAP roof weather station

For SOMORA: ...

## Retrieval
