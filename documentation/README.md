# GROMORA Documentation

This folder contains a specific documentation for the GROMORA project. 

It completes the main user guide which is located at
[UserGuideGROMORA](https://git.iap.unibe.ch/IAP_MCH/UserGuideGROSOM.git) also on
the IAP git server.

The following documentation files are the most important:

* [main](main.md): describes the main script for launching GROMORA calibration and integration.
* [run_calibration](run_calibration.md): describes the calibration sub-routine.
* [run_integration](run_integration.md): describes the integration sub-routine.
* [calibrationTool](calibrationTool.md): describes the *calibrationTool* structure.
* [level1](level1.md): describes the structure and content of the calibrated (level 1a) and integrated (level 1b) output files.
* [quality_control_calibration](quality_control_calibration.md): describes the quality control done during the calibration. 

In [example_level1](example_level1), you can find some examples of level 1a and
1b netCDF files as well as the standard plots for calibrated and integrated
data. 

This documentation tries to make a comprehensive description of the GROMORA
routine which is constantly evolving. Therefore, it might sometimes contain
error or lack updates. In this case, please refer to the author.
