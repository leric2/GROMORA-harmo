# GROSOM_harmo
### Main repository for the harmonization of GROMOS and SOMORA ozone retrieval routines. 

The goal of this repository is to enable anyone concerned at the IAP and at MCH to follow and comment on the progression of the new harmonized retrieval routines. In order to all go in the same (and right) direction from the beginning, the goal is firstly to edit and validate altogether the document **specifications.md** also found in this repository.

Contributions from anyone are more than welcome according to the rules defined in the **contributions.md** documents.
