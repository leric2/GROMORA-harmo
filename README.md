# GROSOM_harmo

## Summary
Main repository for the harmonization of GROMOS and SOMORA ozone calibration and retrieval routines. To go in the direction of a unified calibration routine, the work from Franzisca on the MIAWARA-C instrument is now being incorporated to this routine as well. 

The goal of this repository is to enable anyone concerned at the IAP and at MCH to follow and comment on the progression of the new harmonized retrieval routines. 

## Requirements
TODO

## Structure of the repository
#### documentation 
Main folder containing the documentation of the whole routine, the specifications, the choices made for calibration, etc... It will also contains soon the description of the calibrationTool structure controlling the calibration part.

#### scripts
Containing all scripts in 2 separated folders: 
1. calibration: level0 to level1b, in Matlab for now. 
2. retrieval: level1b to level2, in Python

Each folder contains additional specific documentation. 

#### sketch
outdated for now, but might be useful for the final report time will come
